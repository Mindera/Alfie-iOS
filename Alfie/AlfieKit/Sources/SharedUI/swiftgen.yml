# The code generation is triggered by a SPM plugin using build tools, which doesn't have
# write permissions in project folder, so we define the Derived Data folder as the
# destination folder, then using the build phase script
# 'SwiftGen - Copy generated files from OUTPUT_DIR to Project' we copy the file, rename it
# and uncomment the generated file so we can have a better control of what's changing.
