## How to Use Custom Agents

### On GitHub.com
1. Navigate to a repository issue or discussion
2. Open the agents panel
3. Select agent from dropdown
4. Assign agent to task or ask questions

### In VS Code
1. Open Copilot Chat
2. Click agent dropdown
3. Select your custom agent
4. Chat within agent's context

### In GitHub CLI
```bash
# Use specific agent
gh copilot suggest --agent ios-feature-developer "implement product listing"

# Or in interactive mode
gh copilot chat --agent graphql-specialist
```

### In Other IDEs
- **JetBrains**: Agent dropdown in Copilot panel
- **Xcode**: Agent selection in Copilot interface
- **Eclipse**: Agent profiles in preferences

## Agent Collaboration

Agents are designed to work together, orchestrated by `feature-orchestrator`:

```
Complete Feature Development Flow (Orchestrated):

feature-orchestrator coordinates:
  1. spec-writer → Create specification
  2. mobile-security-specialist → Review security requirements  
  3. graphql-specialist → Create API queries
  4. localization-specialist → Add strings
  5. ios-feature-developer → Implement feature
  6. testing-specialist → Write tests
  7. mobile-security-specialist → Final security audit
  8. feature-orchestrator → Final verification & sign-off
```

**Recommended Approach**: Start with `@feature-orchestrator` for new features. It will coordinate all other agents automatically.

---

## Agent Configuration

Each agent has:
- **Name**: Unique identifier
- **Description**: What the agent does
- **Tools**: Available actions (read, search, edit, create)
- **Instructions**: Detailed responsibilities and patterns

### Tools Explained

- `read`: Read files from repository
- `search`: Search codebase  
- `edit`: Modify existing files AND create new files (includes "Write" capability)

**Note**: 
- The `edit` tool can both modify existing files AND create new files
- `mobile-security-specialist` only has `read` and `search` as it's a review-only agent
- Other available tools (not used): `execute`, `agent`, `web`, `todo`

## Best Practices

### When to Use Which Agent

| Task | Recommended Agent |
|------|-------------------|
| **New feature (end-to-end)** | `feature-orchestrator` ⭐ |
| Implement new feature | `ios-feature-developer` |
| Add GraphQL query | `graphql-specialist` |
| Write tests | `testing-specialist` |
| Security review | `mobile-security-specialist` |
| Create feature spec | `spec-writer` |
| Add translations | `localization-specialist` |

⭐ **Start here for new features** - The orchestrator will coordinate all other agents.

### Agent Selection Tips

✅ **Do**:
- **Start with `feature-orchestrator` for complete features**
- Choose specialized agent for specific tasks
- Let orchestrator coordinate the workflow
- Use spec-writer before implementation
- Use security-specialist for PR reviews

❌ **Don't**:
- Use wrong agent for task (e.g., testing-specialist for feature implementation)
- Skip the orchestrator for complex features
- Skip security reviews
- Forget to generate code after GraphQL changes
- Skip spec creation for new features

## Creating New Agents

To add a new agent:

1. Create `<agent-name>.md` in this directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: agent-identifier
   description: Brief description
   tools: ["read", "search", "edit", "create"]
   ---
   ```
3. Write agent instructions below frontmatter
4. Test agent with real tasks
5. Iterate based on results

---

## Agent Versioning

- Agents are versioned by Git commit SHA
- Use branches/tags for different versions
- Latest version on branch is used when agent assigned
- PR interactions use same agent version for consistency

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not appearing
- Ensure file is in `.github/agents/` directory
- Check YAML frontmatter is valid
- Verify `name` field is unique
- Commit and push changes

### Agent not behaving correctly
- Review agent instructions
- Update agent file with clearer instructions
- Test with smaller, specific tasks first
- Iterate and refine instructions

### Agent conflicts
- Repository-level agents override organization-level
- Use unique names to avoid conflicts
- Check agent priority in Copilot settings
