# Issue tracker: GitHub, derived from Jira

Jira (`ALFMOB`) is the source of truth for what gets built. Specs and tickets for this repo live as
GitHub issues derived from a Jira ticket. Use the `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations.

## Flow

1. A Jira ticket `ALFMOB-<id>` exists first.
2. Grill it (`/grill-with-docs`), then publish the spec and tickets as GitHub issues.
3. Each derived issue's body starts with `Jira: ALFMOB-<id>`.
4. Branch: `feat/ALFMOB-<id>-<slug>`. Work with no Jira ticket: `feat/gh-<n>-<slug>`, where `<n>` is
   the GitHub issue number.

## Jira

Site: `https://mindera.atlassian.net` · Project key: `ALFMOB` ·
cloudId: `d1f0340d-c33e-48c9-b29a-f13d9b14e217`

Read-only unless the user asks for a write. Access is through the Atlassian MCP tools, which are
deferred: load them with `ToolSearch` first.

- **Read a ticket**: `getJiraIssue` with `issueIdOrKey: "ALFMOB-<id>"`,
  `responseContentFormat: "markdown"`; add `comment` to `fields` for the discussion.
- **Search**: `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`, e.g. `project = ALFMOB AND status != Done ORDER BY updated DESC`.

Triage labels are never applied in Jira; see `triage-labels.md`.

## Conventions

Repo: `Mindera/Alfie-iOS`; `gh` infers it inside a clone.

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --json number,title,body,labels,comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**: `gh issue create --parent <parent> ...`, or `gh issue edit <parent> --add-sub-issue <child>` afterwards (`gh` 2.94+). Older `gh`: `gh api --method POST repos/Mindera/Alfie-iOS/issues/<parent>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<child-db-id>` (database id, as in **Blocking** below). Without sub-issues, put `Part of #<parent>` at the top of the child body, under the `Jira:` line.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh api --paginate 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls?state=open' --jq '.[] | select(.author_association | IN("OWNER","MEMBER","COLLABORATOR") | not) | {number, title, author: .user.login, author_association, labels: [.labels[].name]}'`.
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either: resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue whose body starts with `Jira: ALFMOB-<id>`. If no Jira ticket is known, ask
for the key; omit the line only when the user confirms there is none.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

`ALFMOB-<id>` → read it from Jira. `#<n>` → **Read an issue** above; if its body starts with a
`Jira:` line, read that ticket too.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (see **Make an issue a sub-issue of a parent**). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body, under the `Jira:` line. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**, the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/Mindera/Alfie-iOS/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/Mindera/Alfie-iOS/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). GitHub reports `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only, the live gate). Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body, under the `Jira:` and `Part of` lines. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (`gh issue list --state open`, scoped to the map's sub-issues / task list), drop any with an open blocker (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0`, or an open issue in the `Blocked by` line) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: `gh issue comment <n> --body "<answer>"`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.
